# Welcome to Dragons of Mugloar
To run this solution, please first python3 requests library installed.  
To do so, run:
>_$python3 -m pip install requests_ 

If _requests_ library is available, running _main.py_ will start the game.

It is also possible to enable game logging from _mugloarWebClient.py_. Enabling logging will create a new log file for each game that has been played through. With this you can confirm that every move the game does is legitimate.
